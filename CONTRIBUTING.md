# Contributing to Anchor UI

Anchor UI is an open-source project built on top of **Base UI**. The repositories share infrastructure, and many contributing guidelines from Base UI apply to Anchor UI.

Please follow the steps below to contribute to Anchor UI.

## Anchor UI vs. Base UI

Anchor UI is a headless React component library, built using the same code infrastructure as **Base UI**. While it is a standalone library, it leverages many of Base UIâ€™s principles.

You can find the "contributing" guide for the main repository in [Base UI's contributing guide](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Most of the content in the Base UI "contributing" guide applies to this repository. However, there are a few important differences:

- The default GitHub branch might be different.
- The local documentation site for Anchor UI might open on a different port, such as `3005` instead of `3000`.

## Next Steps

If you're ready to contribute to Anchor UI, please read the full contributing guide in Base UI. It covers everything from setting up your local development environment to submitting pull requests.
