# Docs

This is the documentation site for Anchor UI.

To start the docs site in development mode, from the project root, run:

```bash
pnpm start
```

If you do not have pnpm installed, select your OS and follow the instructions on the [pnpm website](https://pnpm.io/installation).

Package managers other than pnpm (like npm or Yarn) are not supported and will not work.

## How can I add a new demo to the documentation?

[Follow this guide](https://github.com/anchorui/ui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to learn how to contribute demos to Anchor UI.

## Acknowledgements

Anchor UI's documentation tooling is built using architectural patterns from Base UI's documentation system. We appreciate their open-source work and continue to evolve the experience with our own design system.
