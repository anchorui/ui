Anchor UI is an opinionated headless React toolkit that helps product teams craft distinctive UI systems. We focus on accessibility, composability, and ergonomic developer experience so you can own every detail without sacrificing speed.  

Our mission is to provide a complete set of open-source primitives, utilities, and patterns that make it easy to build modern SaaS dashboards, internal tools, and consumer apps.  

## Features  

### Fully Customizable  

Anchor UI is unstyled by default, giving you the freedom to adopt Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, inline styles, or any design system you prefer. Compose parts, extend hooks, and layer styling solutions without friction.  

### Accessible  

Accessibility is built into the core of Anchor UI. Components ship with WAI-ARIA compliant patterns, robust keyboard support, and extensive testing across environments so every experience works for everyone.  

### Composable  

Each component exposes modular parts (such as `Root`, `Item`, `Trigger`) and low-level hooks, making it easy to build unique interactions, wrap primitives, or create new variants.  

### Built for Modern UI Development  

From Next.js compatibility to advanced overlays, portal management, and theme utilities, Anchor UI is engineered for today’s product workflows.  

## Acknowledgements  

Anchor UI is built using architectural patterns from the open-source Base UI project. While we leverage proven architecture and patterns, Anchor UI is an independent library with its own codebase, APIs, and roadmap. We're grateful to the Base UI community for their foundational work and architectural contributions. Learn more about Base UI [here](https://mui.com/base/).
