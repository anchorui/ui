  content="An overview of Anchor UI, providing information on its mission, features, and community."  
/>  

Anchor UI extends the foundational work of Base UI, an unstyled React component library created by the teams behind Radix, Material UI, and Floating UI. By leveraging Base UI’s infrastructure, Anchor UI adds a layer of flexibility and customization for developers who want to create accessible and visually appealing user interfaces.  

Our mission is to provide a complete set of open-source, headless, and accessible UI components with enhanced customization options and a focus on developer experience.  

## Features  

### Fully Customizable  

Anchor UI retains the headless, unstyled nature of Base UI but introduces additional flexibility for developers. You can style components using any solution you prefer, such as Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, or plain CSS. Anchor UI encourages developers to create unique designs while maintaining the accessibility and structure provided by Base UI.  

### Accessible  

Accessibility remains at the forefront of Anchor UI, as it builds upon Base UI’s adherence to [WAI-ARIA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/). All components are tested across various environments, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.  

### Composable  

Anchor UI components are designed to be modular and composable. Developers have direct access to component nodes, allowing them to extend, modify, or wrap components according to their needs.  

### Built for Modern UI Development  

Anchor UI introduces additional utilities and patterns tailored for modern frontend development, making it easier to integrate with popular frameworks and libraries like Next.js.  

## Credits  

Anchor UI is built on the robust foundation of Base UI. We are grateful for the work done by the Base UI team in creating a powerful, accessible, and headless component library. You can learn more about Base UI [here](https://mui.com/base/).
