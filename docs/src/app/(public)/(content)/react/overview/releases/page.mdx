  - Renamed core types: `BaseUIComponentProps` → `AnchorUIComponentProps`, `BaseUIEvent` → `AnchorUIEvent`, `WithBaseUIEvent` → `WithAnchorUIEvent`
  - Updated event handler method: `preventBaseUIHandler` → `preventAnchorUIHandler`
  - Migrated all hooks: `useBaseUiId` → `useAnchorId` (68 files updated)
  - Renamed global test variable: `BASE_UI_ANIMATIONS_DISABLED` → `ANCHOR_UI_ANIMATIONS_DISABLED`
  - Updated test infrastructure: `BaseUiConformanceTestsOptions` → `AnchorUIConformanceTestsOptions`, `BaseUITestRenderer` → `AnchorUITestRenderer`
  - Refactored build scripts: `getBaseUiComponentInfo` → `getAnchorUIComponentInfo`
  - Removed deprecated exports and cleaned up all legacy references
- Updated documentation links to point to live site (anchorui.com)
- Updated package description and keywords to emphasize independence

### Technical Notes
